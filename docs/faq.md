# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is Yazi fast?

See [Why is Yazi fast?](/blog/why-is-yazi-fast).

## Why am I getting a "Permission denied" when editing files in Linux/macOS?

Yazi defaults to using `$EDITOR` as the default editor, which is suitable for most cases.

When you encounter this error, it means that `$EDITOR` is not set properly. You can add something like `export EDITOR=vim` to your Bash/Zsh/Fish configuration.
Alternatively, you can change Yazi's [default edit opener](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/blob/main/yazi-config/preset/yazi.toml) from `$EDITOR` to vim/nvim/nano.

## Why can't I preview files on Windows?

<details>
  <summary>Yazi Windows Edition</summary>
  <div>

Have you added Git to the `PATH` according to the [Windows Installation Guide](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/wiki/Windows-Installation-Guide#requirements)?

Please make sure the `file` command is available in your terminal, you can do a `file -v` to verify it.

  <summary>Yazi Linux Edition running on WSL</summary>
  <div>

Limited by ConPTY, the Windows version of Yazi has had to implement many workarounds, which are not perfect.

However, if you run Yazi in WSL, you can experience perfect image previews using `wezterm ssh`.<br/>
[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) is an excellent terminal that can bypass the limitations of ConPTY through its SSH feature, and it's currently the only terminal that supports this approach.

You need to install `sshd` in WSL and start it:

```sh
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo service ssh restart
```

Then, on the host machine, connect to WSL via SSH:

```sh
wezterm ssh 127.0.0.1
```

That's it! you can now get Yazi's image preview working properly.

Before [Add `CSI 14 t` sequence support](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/pull/810) is merged, it is not possible to obtain the actual width and height of the terminal.

Therefore, the Windows version of Yazi currently uses `preview.max_width` and `preview.max_height` specified by the user in the `yazi.toml` as the image size.

## Why do my icons shrink in [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), and enlarge when scrolling?

TL;DR: Use a theme for Yazi, https://github.com/yazi-rs/themes

This might be a bug in kitty (or feature? I don't know). In kitty, you have to add a style to file list items (like foreground color) to make the icons match the text size. However, Yazi's default theme can't add that color, because it can't predict whether the user's terminal has a white background with black text, or a black background with white text.

So it inherits the default terminal font color. This causes the icon size issue, and I've only found this problem in kitty - other terminals don't have it. Therefore, please use a Yazi theme for the kitty terminal.

## Why can't "Open" and "Enter" be a single command?

The decision to separate `enter` and `open` commands was intentional.

Yazi will be adding the ability to treat an archive as a directory in the future, allowing direct operations on the files inside.

An archive is a file, so it's "openable", but it's also "enterable" as a directory; so the user can choose the action they want to do.

This is true for a actual directory as well - a directory can be entered (in Yazi), or opened (in programs like VSCode or desktop file managers).

If you truly don't need to distinguish between them, use this [smart-enter tip](/docs/tips.md#smart-enter-enter-for-directory-open-for-file).

## Why is "orphan" set to false by default?

`orphan=true` is an emergency exit; once specified, your task will not be managed by Yazi.

For instance, if you realize that you've used `unzip` on the wrong files, and you need to cancel it, with `orphan=false`, you can easily do that by pressing `x` in Yazi's task manager.
However, with `orphan=true`, you can only return to the shell to terminate it.

On the other hand, tasks with `orphan=false` are scheduled through the Yazi task system. It can limit the number of concurrent tasks (configurable by the user), to prevent system resource depletion, such as when you're extracting 100 files.

## I don't like nerd‐fonts!

Yazi has `nerd-fonts` enabled by default, it looks really cool!

If you don't want to use it and want things to be calm, sure, you can modify these icons as much as you want in [`theme.toml`](./configuration/theme.md):

```toml
[status]
separator_open = ""
separator_close = ""
```

and

```toml
[icons]
"Desktop/"   = ""
"Documents/" = ""
"Downloads/" = ""
# ...
```

The above code changed all icons to `""`, and the whole world went quiet, nice!

## Why doesn't the XXX feature exist?

Yazi is a new project, with less than 3 months (as of Sep 20, 2023) since its first commit, and some features are still heavily being developed.

If you find that the XXX feature is missing, please check if it has already been mentioned in the [Feature Requests](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/51) and search for related issues. If not, you can create a new request.

Our time slices are limited, and they are allocated to what we consider critical issues, such as bug fixes and making Yazi stable, which includes addressing proposals that could potentially lead to broken changes in the future.

Most maintainers have their full-time jobs, so please understand if your request isn't implemented promptly. Of course, we welcome any constructive PR to help expedite the implementation of your desired feature!

## Why do I need to copy the entire keybindings?

Quoted from [sxyazi/yazi#158 - comment](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/158#issuecomment-1722130381):

> Since Yazi is still in the alpha stage and is not yet stable, default keybindings may undergo adjustments, potentially disrupting user expectations.
>
> Therefore, I encourage users to copy the complete keybinding list, which will not be affected by default configurations. Considering a merge after Yazi stabilizes seems to make more sense.
