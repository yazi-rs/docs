If you haven't created and used your own configuration file yet, please see [Configuration](./overview.md).
:::

## [manager]

- layout: Manager layout by ratio, 3-element array

  - `[1, 4, 3]`: 1/8 width for parent, 4/8 width for current, 3/8 width for preview

- sort_by: File sorting method

  - `"none"`: Don't sort
  - `"alphabetical"`: Sort alphabetically, e.g. `1.md` < `10.md` < `2.md`
  - `"created"`: Sort by creation time
  - `"modified"`: Sort by last modified time
  - `"natural"`: Sort naturally, e.g. `1.md` < `2.md` < `10.md`
  - `"size"`: Sort by file size

- sort_sensitive: Sort case-sensitively

  - `true`: Case-sensitive
  - `false`: Case-insensitive

- sort_reverse: Display files in reverse order

  - `true`: Reverse order
  - `false`: Normal order

- sort_dir_first: Display directories first

  - `true`: Directories first
  - `false`: Respects `sort_by` and `sort_reverse` only

- linemode: Line mode

  - `"none"`: No line mode.
  - `"size"`: Display the size of the file.
  - `"permissions"`: Display the permissions of the file.
  - `"mtime"`: Display the last modified time of the file.

  In addition, you can also specify any 1 to 20 characters, and extend it within a UI plugin.
  Which means you can implement your own linemode through the plugin by simply overriding the [`Folder:linemode` method](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/blob/main/yazi-plugin/preset/components/folder.lua).

- show_hidden: Show hidden files

  - `true`: Show
  - `false`: Do not show

- show_symlink: Show the path of the symlink file point to, after the filename

  - `true`: Show
  - `false`: Do not show

## [preview]

- tab_size: Tab width
- max_width: Maximum preview width for images. Do a `yazi --clear-cache` to take effect after changing this.
- max_height: Maximum preview height for images. Do a `yazi --clear-cache` to take effect after changing this.
- cache_dir: The system cache directory is used by default, and the cached files will go away on a reboot automatically. If you want to make it more persistent, you can specify the cache directory manually as an absolute path.

### Ueberzug-specific

- ueberzug_scale (Float): Ueberzug image scaling ratio, `scale>1` for enlargement, `scale<1` for reduction. For example, `0.5` indicates a reduction to half.
- ueberzug_offset (`[x, y, width, height]`): Ueberzug image offset, in cell units. For example, `[0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5]` indicates that the image is offset by half a cell in both directions, and the width and height are reduced by half a cell.

This is useful for solving [the bug of Ueberzug image size calculation](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp/issues/122).

If your monitor has a `2.0` scale factor, and is running on Wayland under Hyprland, you may need to set `ueberzug_scale: 0.5`, and adjust the value of `ueberzug_offset` according to your case, to offset this issue.

## [opener]

Configure available openers, for example:

```toml
[opener]
archive = [
	{ exec = 'unar "$1"', desc = "Extract here" },
]
text = [
	{ exec = 'nvim "$@"', block = true },
]
# ...
```

Available parameters are as follows:

- exec: The command to open the selected files, with the following variables available:
  - `$n` (Unix) / `%n` (Windows): The N-th selected file, starting from 1
  - `$@` (Unix) / `%*` (Windows): All selected files
  - `foo`: Literal string to be passed
- block (Boolean): Open in a blocking manner. After setting this, Yazi will hide into a secondary screen and display the program on the main screen until it exits. During this time, it can receive I/O signals, which is useful for interactive programs.
- orphan (Boolean): Keep the process running even if Yazi has exited.
- desc: Description of the opener, displayed in the selection menu.
- for: Optional. This opener is only available on this system; when not specified, it's available on all systems. Available values:
  - `unix`: Linux and macOS
  - `windows`: Windows
  - `linux`: Linux
  - `macos`: macOS

## [open]

Set rules for opening specific files, for example:

```toml
[open]
rules = [
	{ mime = "text/*", use = "text" },
	{ mime = "image/*", use = "image" },

	# { mime = "application/json", use = "text" },
	{ name = "*.json", use = "text" },

	# Multiple openers for a single rule
	{ name = "*.html", use = [ "browser", "text" ] },
]
```

Available rule parameters are as follows:

- name (String): Glob expression for matching the file name. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- mime (String): Glob expression for matching the MIME type. Case insensitive by default, add `\s` to the beginning to make it sensitive.
- use (String): Opener name corresponding to the names in the [`[opener]` section](#opener).

## [tasks]

- micro_workers: Maximum number of concurrent micro-tasks
- macro_workers: Maximum number of concurrent macro-tasks
- bizarre_retry: Maximum number of retries when a bizarre failure occurs
- suppress_preload: Exclude the preload tasks created by the system from the task list, do not report their progress, and do not consider them on app exit confirming.

### Image decoding

- image_alloc: Maximum memory allocation limit (in bytes) for decoding a single image, `0` for unlimited.
- image_bound(`[width, height]`): Maximum image size (in pixels) for decoding a single image, `0` for unlimited.

## [input]

You can customize the title and position of each `Input`. As for position, it consists of two parts: [Origin](#origin) and [Offset](#offset).

The origin is the top-left corner of the `Input`, and the offset is the increment from this origin. Together, they determine the area of the `Input` on the screen.

### Origin

For the origin, the following values are available:

- top-left
- top-center
- top-right
- bottom-left
- bottom-center
- bottom-right
- center
- hovered (the cursor position of hovered file)

### Offset

As for the offset, it's a 4-element tuple: `(x, y, width, height)`.

### Placeholder

Some `Input`s have special placeholders that will be replaced with actual content upon display:

- trash_title: String

  - `{n}`: Number of files to be trashed
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

- delete_title: String

  - `{n}`: Number of files to be deleted
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

- find_title: [String, String]
  It's a tuple of 2-element: first for "Find next", second for "Find previous".

- shell_title: [String, String]
  It's a tuple of 2-element: first for "Non-blocking shell", second for "Blocking shell".

- quit_title
  - `{n}`: Number of tasks are running
  - `{s}`: `"s"` if `n > 1`, otherwise `""`

## [select]

Same as [the input](#input).
