## [filetype]

Set file list item display styles for specific file types, supporting matching by name and mime-type:

```toml
[filetype]
rules = [
	# Images
	{ mime = "image/*", fg = "cyan" },

	# Videos
	{ mime = "video/*", fg = "yellow" },
	{ mime = "audio/*", fg = "yellow" },

	# Orphan symbolic links
	{ name = "*", is = "orphan", fg = "red" },

	# ...

	# Fallback
	# { name = "*", fg = "white" },
	{ name = "*/", fg = "blue" }
]
```

Each rule supports complete [Style properties](#style). There are two special rule:

- `name = "*"` matches all files.
- `name = "*/"` matches all directories.

You can restrict the specific type of files through `is`, noting that it must be used with either `name` or `mime`. It accepts the following values:

- `block`: Block device
- `char`: Char device
- `exec`: Executable
- `fifo`: FIFO
- `link`: Symbolic link
- `orphan`: Orphan symbolic link
- `sock`: Socket
- `sticky`: File with sticky bit set

## [icon]

Display icon based on the first matched rule.

You can prepend or append rules to the default through `prepend_rules` and `append_rules`, see [Configuration mixing](/docs/configuration/overview#configuration-mixing) for details.

```toml
[icon]
prepend_rules = [
	{ name = "*.rs"    , text = "" },
	{ name = "Desktop/", text = "" },
	# ...

	# Icon with a color
	{ name = "*.lua", text = "", fg = "#51a0cf" },

	# You can also use `is` rule, just like `[filetype]` section
	# Orphan symbolic links
	{ name = "*", is = "orphan", text = "" },
]

append_rules = [
	# My fallback icons
	{ name = "*" , text = "" },
	{ name = "*/", text = "" },
]
```

Or, use `rules` to rewrite the entire default rules:

```toml
[icon]
rules = [
	# ...Some rules
]
```

End with `/` for directories, so wildcard rule (`*` or `*/`) can be used for fallback matching all files or directories.

If your `append_rules` contains wildcard rules, they will always take precedence over the default wildcard rules as the fallback.
