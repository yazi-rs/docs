## üíñ Add yours {#add-yours}

We are so happy to add your plugin to this page!

If your plugin meets the following requirements, please click "Edit this page" below to add it:

- **Functional** - we will install and test it, since we want all links included on this page to be valid. If it's available only on a specific platform, a note should be added in the README.
- **Follow conventions** - it should be a directory/repository ending with `.yazi`, and include the files listed in the [plugin documentation](/docs/plugins/overview).

If it's a Neovim or Shell plugin, appending `.nvim` or `.sh` to the name to make it distinguishable is a best practice, but it's not required.
