# Utils

## ya

### `hide()` {#ya.hide}

Hide Yazi to the secondary screen by returning to the terminal, completely controlled by the requested plugin.

```lua
local permit = ya.hide()
```

This method returns a `permit` for this resource. When it's necessary to restore the TUI display, call its `drop()` method:

```lua
permit:drop()
```

Note that since there's always only one available terminal control resource, `ya.hide()` cannot be called again before the previous `permit` is dropped, otherwise an error will be thrown, effectively avoiding deadlocks.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `file_cache(opts)` {#ya.file_cache}

Calculate the cached [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) corresponding to the given file:

- `opts` - Required, the options of the cache, which is a table:

  - `file` - The [File](/docs/plugins/types#shared.file) to be cached
  - `skip` - The number of units to skip. It's units largely depend on your previewer, such as lines for code, and percentages for videos

If the file is not allowed to be cached, such as it's ignored in the user config, or the file itself is a cache, returns `nil`.

### `manager_emit(cmd, args)` {#ya.manager_emit}

Send a command to the [`[manager]`](/docs/configuration/keymap#manager) without waiting for the executor to execute:

- `cmd` - Required, the command name, which is a string
- `args` - Required, the arguments of the command, which is a table with a number or string key and [sendable values](/docs/plugins/overview#sendable)

```lua
ya.manager_emit("my-cmd", { "hello", 123, foo = true, bar_baz = "world" })

-- Equivalent to:
-- my-cmd "hello" "123" --foo --bar-baz="world"
```

### `image_show(url, rect)` {#ya.image_show}

Display the given image within the specified area, and the image will downscale to fit that area automatically:

- `url` - Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image
- `rect` - Required, the [Rect](/docs/plugins/layout#rect) of the area

This function is only available in the async context.

### `image_precache(src, dist)` {#ya.image_precache}

Pre-cache the image to a specified url based on user-configured [`max_width` and `max_height`](/docs/configuration/yazi#preview):

- `src` - Required, the source [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image
- `dist` - Required, the destination [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the image

This function is only available in the async context.

### `which(opts)` {#ya.which}

Prompt users with a set of available keys:

- `opts`: Required, the options of the prompt, which is a table:
  - `cands`: Required, the key candidates, which is a table of tables that contains the following fields:
    - `on`: Required, the key to be prompted, which is a string or a table of strings if multiple keys
    - `desc`: Optional, the description of the key, which is a string
  - `silent`: Optional, whether to show the UI of key indicator, which is a boolean

```lua
local cand = ya.which {
	cands = {
		{ on = "a" },
		{ on = "b", desc = "optional description" },
		{ on = "<C-c>", desc = "key combination" },
		{ on = { "d", "e" }, desc = "multiple keys" },
	},
	-- silent = true, -- If you don't want to show the UI of key indicator
}
```

When the user clicks a valid candidate, `ya.which` returns the 1-based index of that `cand`;
otherwise, it returns nil, indicating that the user has canceled the key operation.

This function is only available in the async context.

### `input(opts)` {#ya.input}

Request user input:

- `opts`: Required, the options of the input, which is a table:
  - `title`: Required, the title of the input, which is a string.
  - `value`: Optional, the default value of the input, which is a string.
  - `position`: Required, the position of the input, which is a table:
    - `1`: Required, the origin position of the input, which is a string accepts `"top-left"`, `"top-center"`, `"top-right"`, `"bottom-left"`, `"bottom-center"`, `"bottom-right"`, `"center"`, and `"hovered"`.
    - `x`: Optional, the X offset from the origin position, which is an positive or negative integer.
    - `y`: Optional, the Y offset from the origin position, which is an positive or negative integer.
    - `w`: Required, the width of the input, which is an positive integer.
    - `h`: Optional, the height of the input, which is an positive integer.
  - `realtime`: Optional, whether to report user input in real time, which is a boolean.
  - `debounce`: Optional, the number of seconds to wait for the user to stop typing, which is a positive float. Can only be used when `realtime = true`. (Currently needs the nightly version of Yazi)

```lua
local value, event = ya.input {
	title = "Archive name:",
	position = { "top-center", y = 3, w = 40 },
}
```

Returns `(value, event)`:

- `value` - The user input value carried by this event, which is a string if the `event` is non-zero; otherwise, `nil`.
- `event` - The event type, which is an integer:
  - 0: Unknown error.
  - 1: The user has confirmed the input.
  - 2: The user has canceled the input.
  - 3: The user has changed the input (only if `realtime` is true).

When `realtime = true` specified, `ya.input()` returns a receiver, which has a `recv()` method that can be called multiple times to receive events.

```lua
local input = ya.input {
	title = "Input in realtime:",
	position = { "center", w = 50 },
	realtime = true,
}

while true do
	local value, event = input:recv()
	if not value then
		break
	end

	ya.err(value)
end
```

This function is only available in the async context.

  - `level`: Optional, the level of the notification, which is a string accepts `"info"`, `"warn"`, and `"error"`. Default is `"info"`.

```lua
ya.notify {
	title = "Hello, World!",
	content = "This is a notification from Lua!",
	timeout = 6.5,
	-- level = "info",
}
```

### `dbg(msg, ...)` {#ya.dbg}

ya.dbg("Hello", "World!")                       -- Multiple arguments are supported
ya.dbg({ foo = "bar", baz = 123, qux = true })  -- Any type of data is supported
```

Note that if you use a release build of Yazi, the log level is "error" instead of "debug", so you'll need to use [`ya.err`](#ya.err).

### `err(msg, ...)` {#ya.err}

Append messages to [the log file](/docs/plugins/overview#logging) at the error level:

- `msg` - Required, the message to be logged.

```

### `sync(fn)` {#ya.sync}

## ps {#ps}

Yazi's DDS (Data Distribution Service) uses a Lua-based publish-subscribe model as its carrier. That is, you can achieve cross-instance communication and state persistence through the `ps` API. See [DDS](/docs/dds) for details.

The following functions can only be used within a sync context.

### `pub(kind, value)` {#ps.pub}

```lua
ps.pub("greeting", "Hello, World!")
```

Publish a message to the current instance, and all plugins subscribed through `sub()` for this `kind` will receive it, achieving internal communication within the instance:

- `kind` - Required, the kind of the message, which is a string of alphanumeric with dashes, and cannot be [built-in kinds](/docs/dds#builtin).
- `value` - Required, the value of the message, which is a [sendable value](/docs/plugins/overview#sendable)

Since the `kind` is used globally, to add the plugin name as the prefix is a best practice. For example, the combination of the plugin `my-plugin` and the kind `event1` would be `my-plugin-event1`.

### `pub_to(receiver, kind, value)` {#ps.pub_to}

```lua
ps.pub_to(1711957283332834, "greeting", "Hello, World!")
```

Publish a message to a specific instance with `receiver` as the ID:

- If the receiver is the current instance (local), and is subscribed to this `kind` through `sub()`, it will receive this message.
- If the receiver is not the current instance (remote), and is subscribed to this `kind` through `sub_remote()`, it will receive this message.

With:

- `receiver` - Required, ID of the remote instance, which is a integer; if it's `0` then broadcasting to all remote instances
- `kind` - The same as `pub()`
- `value` - The same as `pub()`

### `pub_static(severity, kind, value)` {#ps.pub_static}

```lua
-- Broadcast and store a static message
ps.pub_static(10, "greeting", "Hello, World!")
-- Broadcast and remove a static message
ps.pub_static(10, "greeting", nil)
```

Broadcast a static message to all remote instances subscribed to this `kind` through `sub_remote()`:

- `severity` - Required, the severity of the message, which is an integer with a range of 0 to 65535
- `kind` - The same as `pub()`
- `value` - The same as `pub()`. If the value is `nil`, the static message will be unpersisted.

The message will be stored as static data to achieve state persistence, and when a new instance is created, it will receive all static messages broadcasted by `sub_remote()` before in descending order of `severity` to restore its state from the data.

If you simply want to broadcast a message to all remote instances, without the need for the message to be persisted, use `ps.pub_to()` with receiver `0` instead.

### `sub(kind, callback)` {#ps.sub}

```lua
ps.sub("cd", function(body)
	ya.err("New cwd", cx.active.current.cwd)
end)
```

Subscribe to local messages of `kind` and call the `callback` handler for it:

- `kind` - Required, the kind of the message, which is a string
- `callback` - Required, the callback function, with a single parameter `body` containing the content of the message

which runs in a sync context, so you can access app data via `cx` for the content of interest.

Note: No time-consuming operations should be done in the callback, and the same `kind` from the same plugin can only be subscribed once, re-subscribing (`sub()`) before unsubscribing (`unsub()`) will throw an error.

### `sub_remote(kind, callback)` {#ps.sub_remote}

Similar to `sub()`, but it subscribes to remote messages of this `kind` instead of local.

### `unsub(kind)` {#ps.unsub}

```lua
ps.unsub("my-message")
```

Unsubscribe from local messages of this `kind`:

- `kind` - Required, the kind of the message, which is a string

### `unsub_remote(kind)` {#ps.unsub_remote}

```lua
ps.unsub_remote("my-message")
```

Unsubscribe from remote messages of this `kind`:

- `kind` - Required, the kind of the message, which is a string

## fs

The following functions can only be used within an async context.

### `write(url, data)` {#fs.write}

```lua
local ok, err = fs.write(url, "hello world")
```

Write data to the specified file:

- `url` - Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the file
- `data` - Required, the data to be written, which is a string

Returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok` - Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

### `cha(url)` {#fs.cha}

```lua
local cha, err = fs.cha(url)
```

Get the [Cha](/docs/plugins/types#shared.cha) of the specified file, which is faster than [`cha_follow()`](#fs.cha_follow) since it never follows the symbolic link:

- `url` - Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the file

Returns `(cha, err)`:

- `cha` - The [Cha](/docs/plugins/types#shared.cha) of the file if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

### `cha_follow(url)` {#fs.cha_follow}

```lua
local cha, err = fs.cha_follow(url)
```

Get the [Cha](/docs/plugins/types#shared.cha) of the specified file, and follow the symbolic link:

- `url` - Required, the [Url](/docs/plugins/types#shared.url) of the file

Returns `(cha, err)`:

- `cha` - The [Cha](/docs/plugins/types#shared.cha) of the file if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

## Command

You can invoke external programs through:

```lua
local child, err = Command("ls")
	:args({ "-a", "-l" })
	:stdout(Command.PIPED)
	:spawn()
```

Compared to Lua's `os.execute`, it provides many comprehensive and convenient methods, and the entire process is async.

It takes better advantage of the benefits of concurrent scheduling. However, it can only be used in async contexts, such as preloaders, previewers, and async functional plugins.

### `arg(arg)` {#Command.arg}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):arg("-a"):arg("-l")
```

Append an argument to the command:

- `arg` - Required, the argument to be appended, which is a string

Returns `self`.

### `args(args)` {#Command.args}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):args({ "-a", "-l" }):args({ "-h" })
```

Append multiple arguments to the command:

- `args` - Required, the arguments to be appended, which is a table of strings

Returns `self`.

### `cwd(dir)` {#Command.cwd}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):cwd("/root")
```

Set the current working directory of the command:

- `dir` - Required, the directory of the command, which is a string

Returns `self`.

### `env(key, value)` {#Command.env}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):env("PATH", "/bin"):env("HOME", "/home")
```

Append an environment variable to the command:

- `key` - Required, the key of the environment variable, which is a string
- `value` - Required, the value of the environment variable, which is a string

Returns `self`.

### `stdin(cfg)` {#Command.stdin}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):stdin(Command.PIPED)
```

Set the stdin of the command:

- `cfg` - Required, the configuration of the stdin, accepts the following values:
  - `Command.PIPED` - Pipe the stdin
  - `Command.NULL` - Discard the stdin
  - `Command.INHERIT` - Inherit the stdin

If not set, the stdin will be null. Returns `self`.

### `stdout(cfg)` {#Command.stdout}

```lua
local cmd = Command("ls"):stdout(Command.PIPED)
```

Set the stdout of the command:

- `cfg` - Required, the configuration of the stdout, accepts the following values:
  - `Command.PIPED` - Pipe the stdout
  - `Command.NULL` - Discard the stdout

If not set, the stderr will be null. Returns `self`.

### `spawn()` {#Command.spawn}

```lua
local child, err = Command("ls"):spawn()
```

Spawn the command, returns `(child, err)`:

- `child` - The [Child](#child) of the command if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

### `output()` {#Command.output}

```lua
local output, err = Command("ls"):output()
```

Spawn the command and wait for it to finish, returns `(output, err)`:

- `output` - The [Output](#output) of the command if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

## Child

This object is created by [`Command:spawn()`](#Command.spawn) and represents a running child process.

You can access the runtime data of this process through its proprietary methods.

### `read(len)` {#Child.read}

```lua
local data, event = child:read(1024)
```

Let's say "available data source" refers to `stdout` or `stderr` that has been set with `Command.PIPED`, or them both.

`read()` reads data from the available data source alternately, and the `event` indicates the source of the data:

- The data comes from stdout if event is 0
- The data comes from stderr if event is 1
- There's no data to read from both stdout and stderr, if event is 2

### `read_line()` {#Child.read_line}

```lua
local line, event = child:read_line()
```

Similar to [`read()`](#Child.read), but it reads data line by line.

### `read_line_with(opts)` {#Child.read_line_with}

```lua
local line, event = child:wait_line_with { timeout = 500 }
```

Similar to [`read_line()`](#Child.read_line), but it accepts a table of options:

- `timeout` - Required, timeout in milliseconds, which is an integer

And includes the following additional events:

- Timeout if event is 3

### `wait()` {#Child.wait}

```lua
local status, err = child:wait()
```

Wait for the child process to finish, returns `(status, err)`:

- `status` - The [Status](#status) of the child process if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

### `wait_with_output()` {#Child.wait_with_output}

```lua
local output, err = child:wait_with_output()
```

Wait for the child process to finish and get the output, returns `(output, err)`:

- `output` - The [Output](#output) of the child process if successful; otherwise, `nil`
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

### `start_kill()` {#Child.start_kill}

```lua
local ok, err = child:start_kill()
```

Send a SIGTERM signal to the child process, returns `(ok, err)`:

- `ok` - Whether the operation is successful, which is a boolean
- `err` - The error code if the operation is failed, which is an integer if any

## Output

Properties:

- `status`: The [Status](#status) of the child process
- `stdout`: The stdout of the child process, which is a string
- `stderr`: The stderr of the child process, which is a string

## Status

This object represents the exit status of a child process, and it is created by [`wait()`](#Child.wait), or [`output()`](#Command.output).

### `success()` {#Status.success}

```lua
local ok = status:success()
```

Returns whether the child process exited successfully, which is a boolean.

### `code()` {#Status.code}
